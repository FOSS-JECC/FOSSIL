FOSSIL(Free and Open Source Software Interactive Learning) is an initiative by the FOSS club of Jyothi to conduct a one day interactive program and a contest for students to learn more about programming and other related skills for their personal growth.  This would be a better opportunity for the students to upskill their knowledge.
